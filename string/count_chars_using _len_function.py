string = '''Dear Parents
This is to inform you that C.B.S.E is organizing a four day capacity building program in our school from 27 august to 30th august 2019 and DAVCAE is organizing performance enhancement program on 31st august 2019. As the principal & the teachers will remain busy during these 5 days, they shall not be able to address your problem. Therefore you are requested not to visit the school on these mentioned dates and face inconvenience.
However the fee counter will remain open for transactions if any. Looking forward to your continued support and co-operation
Regards
Archana Koul'''
